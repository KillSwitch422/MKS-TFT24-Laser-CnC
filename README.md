# MKS-TFT-NEW-PICTURES
New LCD pictures for 3d printer display from MAKERBASE-MKS
This repository contains a full set of customized pictures (91 files) for Makerbase MKS TFT Display.
In the LCD directory you can find the LCD files (*.bin), ready for upload to the display flash memory. Please, follow the Makerbase manual.
Also has been included the source files *.svg, if you want modify them. I used ìInkscapeî for create the pictures, a nice open source application.
The display allows 7 custom buttons; I configured one for clean or remove printed objects.
